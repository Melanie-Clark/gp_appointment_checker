# GP New Appointment Notifications

_Note: App currently under development_

_Designed for macOS and TPP SystmOnline users only_

This MacOS app sends an **e-mail notification** when **new GP appointments** become available via **SystmOnline**:

https://systmonline.tpp-uk.com/2/MainMenu

It uses Selenium to automate logging in to your GP surgeryâ€™s SystmOnline portal, checks the appointment list, and notifies you when a new appointment becomes available.

When the application is first run, the app will initially e-mail you a list of all available appointments, followed by any new appointments e-mail notifications as and when they become available (_whilst the application is running_).

## Benefits
As we all know GP surgeries are increasingly busy, and it can be difficult to get an appointment. This app helps by:
- Reducing the manual effort of repetitively logging in and checking for new appointments
- No need to remember your login details - Helpful if like me you keep forgetting them!
- Perfect opportunity to grab that next available appointment before someone else
- Saving you valuable time to continue with your day
